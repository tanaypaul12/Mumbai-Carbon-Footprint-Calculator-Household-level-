**Mumbai-Carbon-Footprint-Calculator-Household-level **

**Overview**

This project provides a comprehensive carbon footprint calculator specifically tailored for Mumbai households. It uses Maharashtra-specific emission factors from authoritative sources to deliver accurate estimates of household emissions across key categories: electricity, transportation, diet, waste, and more.Here other cities are Mubai, Pune, Nasik, Aurangabad other cities and rural areas

** For An Example**
 
 Mumbai-Specific: Uses local emission factors from CEA, PPAC, TERI, and other Maharashtra-specific sources

 Interactive Interface: User-friendly widgets for easy data input

 Visualization: Multiple chart types (bar, pie, trend analysis) using matplotlib and plotly

 Detailed Reporting: Comprehensive PDF report generation

 Personalized Recommendations: Actionable suggestions based on your footprint

 Export Capabilities: Export results to CSV and PDF formats

 Scenario Analysis: "What-if" analysis for different lifestyle changes





 **Sample Results**

Category	Percentage	Key Insight
Electricity	51%	Dominant contributor due to AC and appliance usage
Food	17%	Diet choices significantly impact emissions
LPG Cooking	14%	Major fossil fuel contributor
Transport	11%	Lower than average thanks to public transport
Waste	6%	High reduction potential with segregation
Average Mumbai Household: 1.93 tons CO₂/year (20.8% above Maharashtra average)
